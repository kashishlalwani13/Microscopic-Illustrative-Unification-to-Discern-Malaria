ðŸ¦  Microscopic Illustrative Unification to Discern Malaria

This project leverages deep learning to automate the detection of malaria-infected cells in microscopic blood images. Using preprocessed image data and neural networks, it classifies whether a given cell is healthy or infected.

ðŸ§  Model Overview

CNN-based architecture trained on labeled microscopy images.

Uses transfer learning and image preprocessing techniques for improved accuracy.

Evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall.
